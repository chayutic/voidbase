# Changelog — Voidbase

## v0.5.3 — 2026-03-12
*Layout Customizer fixes and Markets improvements*

### Changed
- `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` is now snapshotted from the DOM at parse time (before any saved layout is applied), ensuring the reset button always restores the intended section order regardless of environment
- `loadLayout()` now merges saved layout against the DOM snapshot — stale section IDs are dropped, and any newly added sections not present in the saved layout are appended rather than silently omitted
- Markets section now caches fetched chart data in memory keyed by symbol and range — switching ticker count or toggling expanded charts repaints from cache instead of re-fetching from the API; background refresh still runs on the 60s interval
- `renderGrid()` rewritten to diff against existing cards instead of destroying and rebuilding — existing cards are reordered or removed in-place, eliminating chart flash adjusting ticker count and minimizing it when toggling expansion

### Fixed
- Reset button on live site was restoring a previously saved user arrangement instead of the default order

## v0.5.2 — 2026-03-10
*Theme system overhaul, Layout Customizer, and code cleanup*

### Added
- Black and White themes (Obsidian Black, Spirit White), Spirit White effectively serves as Light Mode
- Layout Customizer — drag-and-drop section reordering and visibility toggles, accessible from Control Panel
- `VERSION` JS constant as single source of truth for version string across footer and Control Panel, hopefully I remember to change them going forward
- Version stamp in Control Panel footer (quick fix for floating gear icon obfuscating the last item in the menu)

### Changed
- Theme system refactored — colour themes now use explicit `body[data-theme]` blocks instead of a single derived `--theme-hue`; Black and White themes define their own full token sets
- New color variables added to replace hardcoded `oklch()` values throughout
- Active swatch ring changed from `--accent-muted` to `--text-primary`; inactive rings removed
- Removed `opacity` from text elements — replaced with explicit `--text-primary` / `--text-secondary` colour values throughout
- Light mode placeholder removed from Control Panel (White theme is now a swatch)

### Fixed
- Various dead and/or duplicate CSS rules

## v0.5.1 — 2026-03-09
*New Arrivals fixes & improvements*

### Added
- **Jellyfin image proxy** — poster art now loads outside local network via `GET /jellyfin/image/:itemId`; images cached for 24h
- **Split library card** — "Go to Library" (local) and "Watch on Voidport" (watch.voidport.com) as separate links in the last card

## v0.5.0 — 2026-03-09
*New Arrivals section, visual updates & code cleanup*

### Added
- **New Arrivals section** — horizontally scrollable row of recently added media pulled from Jellyfin
- Separate slots for movies (3) and episodes (3) — forced representation for both types regardless of download timing
- Server-side episode deduplication — one card per series, most recent episode shown
- Poster art fetched via Jellyfin Images API with series poster fallback for episodes lacking their own image
- "Go to Library" card at end of row links to Jellyfin
- Two new Express proxy routes: `GET /jellyfin/recent` and `GET /jellyfin/poster/:seriesId`
- `JELLYFIN_URL` and `JELLYFIN_KEY` environment variables added to `.env`

### Changed
- Various spacing and font changes for a more consitent look.
- Variable name changes for more consistent naming convention.
- Reordered CSS blocks to match visual order of the site.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-03-08
*Turbo Mode, search presets, footer*

### Added
- **Turbo Mode** — collapsible panel below search bar; toggle reveals Web Results Only, Open in New Tab, and Search Presets
- **Search Presets** — save up to 6 query prefixes, persisted in localStorage; active preset prepended to search query on submit; click active preset again to deselect
- Preset add row with Save and Cancel buttons; Escape key closes and resets
- Preset edit button (pencil icon, appears on hover) — inline rename, Enter to commit, Escape to cancel; active preset follows rename
- Preset remove button (× icon, appears on hover)
- Preset label truncation with fade-out mask on overflow
- **Footer** — more vibes and Back to Top link
- Smooth scroll via `scroll-behavior: smooth` on `html`
- Escape key closes Game Deals add row and Search Presets add row, removing active state
- Escape key blurs Google search input

### Changed
- Web Results Only toggle moved inside Turbo Mode panel
- Cancel buttons hidden at ≤425px — + button rotates 45° to × as close affordance on both Game Deals and Search Presets
- × Button SVGs replaced with rotated + button for consistency.
- `renderPresets` rewritten with DOM methods — no user data interpolated into `innerHTML`
- Responsive breakpoints, spacing, and size adjustments for visual consistency.

### Fixed
- Search game input `min-width: 0` prevents it pushing Search button out of frame at narrow viewports

## v0.4.1 — 2025-03-07
*Steam reviews, guest mode, color variables*

### Added
- **Steam reviews column** in Game Deals — shows review description and count fetched from Steam's appreviews API, folded into existing `/steam/price/:appid` endpoint
- Review sentiment color coded using `--steam-positive`, `--steam-mixed`, `--steam-negative` variables
- Responsive review column: full text label ≥650px, SVG thumb icon + count at 500–649px, hidden below 500px
- Icon scheme: thumb up/down SVG with `+` / `++` / `−` / `−−` modifiers for sentiment intensity; Mixed renders as text only
- Hover tooltip on icon view shows full label and review count
- Review count formatted by magnitude: exact below 1k, one decimal `2.4k` up to 9.9k, rounded `24k` / `102k` above
- **Guest Mode** toggle in Control Panel — hides all homelab sections (Media Automation, Media & Photos, Local Network, Website & CMS, Utilities), persisted in localStorage
- Unified highlight color variables: `--green-highlights`, `--red-highlights`, `--orange-highlights` replacing scattered inline oklch values throughout

### Changed
- Game Deals table column order updated: Title / Reviews / Price / Sale / 90D Low
- `/steam/price/:appid` endpoint now returns `reviewDesc` and `reviewCount` alongside price via parallel fetch
- All inline highlight oklch values in CSS replaced with named variables

### Fixed
- Search input and button height mismatch resolved — explicit `height`, `display: flex`, `align-items: center` on both, vertical padding removed

- Sort by highest discount
- **Force 90D Low** setting in control panel — 90D Low column hidden below 425px by default, toggle overrides

### Changed
- THB prices displayed as whole numbers (no decimal points)
- 90D Low shown as percentage rather than price for regional consistency
